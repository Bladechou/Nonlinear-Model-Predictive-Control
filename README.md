This project is the course project of EE 372 Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control
The aim of this project is to devclope a NMPC-based controller to achieve trajectory tracking of a quadrotor
subject to constrained inputs.

The optimal control problem is reformulated into a nonlinear programming problem, then being solved by
open-source optimization tool CasADi.
